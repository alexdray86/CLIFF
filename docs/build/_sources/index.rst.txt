Overview of the methods
=======================


**CLIFF** uncovers the impact of specific cell subtypes on drug response by integrating single-cell RNA-seq and ex-vivo drug sensitivity assays. In particular, **CLIFF** relies on integrating cell subtype abundance and cell-type expression with bulk drug sensitivity to infer the cell subtypesâ€™ drug susceptibility. Cell subtype abundance / expression can be measured with scRNA-seq or inferred with `CLIMB <https://github.com/alexdray86/CLIMB>`_ or any other bulk deconvolution technique.

**CLIFF** relies on a new mathematical model using cell-subtype- associated latent variables, which we resolve with an Expectation-Maximization algorithm.
