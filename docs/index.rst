=======================

**CLIFF** integrates cell subtype abundance and expression with bulk drug sensitivity to infer the cell subtypesâ€™ drug susceptibility. CLIFF relies on a new mathematical model using cell-subtype- associated latent variables, which we resolve with an Expectation-Maximization algorithm.
