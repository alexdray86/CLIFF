The CLIFF method deconvolute cell subtypes drug sensitivity by integrating single-cell RNA sequencing data and ex-vivo drug sensitivity assays. For that matter, CLIFF leverages cell-subtype abundance and cell-type expression with bulk drug sensitivity to infer the drug susceptibility of individual cell subtypes. The measurement of cell-subtype abundance and expression can be accomplished through single-cell RNA sequencing or inferred through the use of techniques such as CLIMB or other bulk deconvolution methods.
